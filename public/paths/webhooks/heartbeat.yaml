  summary: Sending Heartbeats
  operationId: heartbeat
  description: event(heartbeat) 
    Clients must continuously send an event for the server to
    know if connection is still on. If a client has not sent any event
    after one minute, the server will close the connection.
    
    Instead of sending events that modify the game state,
    the **heartbeat** event can be sent with an empty body.

      * `0` is equivalent to Stockfish's skill level **1** and
        is considered the easy mode.
      * `1` is equivalent to Stockfish's skill level **4**, which is perfect
        for more intermediate players.
      * `2` is equivalent to Stockfish's skill level **7**, which is the hardest
        a human should be able to beat.
